* [Prerequisites](./PREREQUISITES.md)

## Assumptions

0. You are on a Mac
0. When a code snippet is given, lines prefixed with `$` means they are entered on the command line, and the output is usually listed below it.
0. You have a working Docker daemon running on a Docker Machine VM (`docker ps` and `docker login` both succeed) -- if not, follow the directions in prerequisites.
